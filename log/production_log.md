# Production log

Append-only. One entry per generation, render or action: timestamp, shot ID and stage code where there is one, model and version, prompt, seed, inputs, outputs, kept or rejected, and the command that regenerates it.

## 2026-10-19T11:51:02-04:00 — Setup: repo scaffolding and environment script

- **What:** Read the brief (Claude Doc `S37uBB1UQJGfxSWx7wQ6Ek`, rev 9) in full. Surveyed the box: RTX 5090 32 GB (driver 595.99.02), 38 GB RAM and 4 GB swap, Ubuntu 26.04.1. Blender 5.2.2 LTS, ffmpeg 8.0.1 with libx264, Node v24.22.0 and uv 0.13.0 were already installed, matching Ghost in the Machine. ComfyUI and the model weights were not installed. Read-Only is not on the box.
- **Wrote:**
  - `scripts/setup_env.sh`: installs and checks every stage's tools, then writes `log/environment.txt`. It is idempotent; `--no-models` and `--check-only` are options.
  - `config/models.tsv`: ComfyUI weights, pinned to Hugging Face revisions.
  - `pyproject.toml`: Python 3.12, torch 2.8 cu128, WhisperX 3.8.6.
  - `package.json`: puppeteer 24.43.1.
  - `.gitignore`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `log/decisions.md` (Read-Only substitute, model choices).
  - `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` (rejects staged files over 50 MiB) and `scripts/manifest.sh`, both from Ghost in the Machine.
- **Model research (2026-10-19):** the native ComfyUI LTX-2.3 docs (https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/video/ltx/ltx-2-3) list the files for IA2V (lip sync) and IC-LoRA Union Control (video-to-video). Hugging Face listings gave the FLUX.2 fp8 split files (Comfy-Org/flux2-dev). None of the repos is gated.
- **Fix during the first run:** `grep -q` in a pipeline under `set -o pipefail` let ffmpeg die of SIGPIPE, so the libx264 check failed falsely. Changed to `grep … >/dev/null`.
- **Command:** `scripts/setup_env.sh` (running; its checks are logged when it finishes).
- **Why:** The user asked for everything required to be installed and written down as a script that replicates the environment.
